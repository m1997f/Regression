# Regression
Thanks to Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Sciene (https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/), In this project, I want to examine the regreesion models (Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression) to find out the best model for my dataset given UCI Machine Learning Repository.
This dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years and we want to try to predict an energy output without understanding how it works or sience behind the energy. For predicting it we have 4 features which are:
1- AT : ambient Temperature in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C,
2- V : Exhaust Vacuum  in the range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg,
3- AP : Ambient Pressure in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar,
4- RH : Relative Humidity in the range 25.56% to 100.16%
